I am a Ph.D. student with interests in remote sensing, geospatial data analytics, and planetary surface processes. My current research focuses on quantifying the evolution of modern fluvial landscapes and their preservation in the ancient rock record using high-resolution topography, time-lapse satellite imagery, numerical models, and field data. Ultimately, I seek to develop methods that enable better prediction of the geomorphic evolution of rivers and the architecture of their resultant deposits, which has applications in infrastructure management, energy exploration, and carbon sequestration. Over the last few years, I have started to dive deeper into the development of python-based workflows for processing, analyzing, and visualizing high-resolution imagery and topography and have recently started working on problems related to image segmentation and classification.

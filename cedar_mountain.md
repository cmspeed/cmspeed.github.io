My research in large part is centered around understanding the evolution of planetary landscapes, from the process of river meandering, avulsion, and cutoff, to the preservation and evolution of landforms. If we have a good understanding of linkages between modern fluvial processes and the deposits that are left behind, then we may be able to obtain a better grasp on the configuration of paleo landscapes on Earth or other planets in our solar system.

Generally, we assume that the ancient stratigraphic record was constructed by similar if not identical processes as those seen in the modern. However, when only the stratigraphic record is available, piecing together the formative sotry can be very challenging.  Therefore, recognition criterea (and hypotheses) are valuable tools for accurate reconstructions of ancient landscapes.

A relatively few number of locations on Earth exist where the planform configuration of ancient channel belts can be seen. A relatively comprehensive list of such locations has been compiled by Zaki et al. (2020).  
Headings are cool

3-D outcrop models produced from structure-from-motion photogrammetry techniques allow us to map and integrate data.

Aren't headings cool?

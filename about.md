My name is Cole Speed, and I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Geological Sciences and a graduate researcher in the Quantitative Clastics Laboratory (QCL) at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests lie at the intersection of remote sensing, geospatial data analytics,and planetary surface processes. My current research focuses on characterizing the evolution of modern fluvial landscapes and their preservation in the ancient rock record using high-resolution topography, satellite imagery, stratigraphic models, and field geologic techniques. River banks are home to a large portion of the global population, and river deposits are and will continue to be important resources for energy and carbon storage. My research is aimed at predicting both the evolution of rivers and the architecture of their deposits. 

My interests are continually evolving, but are all tied into a general theme of code development and generating Python-based workflows for analyzing geospatial data.  I enjoy teaching and have been fortunate for the opportunity to TA several courses in geographic information systems and remote sensing methods.

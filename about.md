My name is Cole Speed, and I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Geological Sciences and a graduate researcher in the Quantitative Clastics Laboratory (QCL) at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests lie at the intersection of remote sensing, geospatial data analytics,and planetary surface processes. My current research focuses on characterizing the evolution of modern fluvial landscapes and their preservation in the ancient rock record using high-resolution topography, time-lapse satellite imagery, simple kinematic models, and field data. Ultimately, my work aims to predict both the evolution of rivers and the architecture of their resultant deposits, which has applications both in infrastructure management and in energy exploration / carbon sequestration. 

My interests are continually evolving, and in the last few years I have started to dive much deeper into coding and the development of python-based workflows for processing and analyzing high-resolution imagery and topography. I've been fortunate for the opportunity to TA several courses in GIS/GPS and remote sensing methods, which has allowed me to further explore and expand these interests.
